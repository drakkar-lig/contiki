This example is equivalent to the one in examples/ipv6/rpl-udp

RAWMAC is a radio duty cycling protocol very similar to ContikiMAC, but with an exploitation
of the routing topology, built by RPL, to make each node align its wake-up phase with that of its
preferred parent.
In this way, a data propagation “wave” is created from the leaves of the tree to the root,
in order to reduce delay for data collection.

To run RAWMAC you only need to change RDC layer (ContikiMAC is the default one), by declaring it properly in the project-conf.h file.
You do not need to modify anything in the application.
